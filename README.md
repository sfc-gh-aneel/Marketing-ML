# Financial Services ML Pipeline - Snowflake Demo

A complete, production-ready ML pipeline for financial services built natively in Snowflake. Demonstrates 401(k) to wealth advisory conversion prediction with 23% improvement and $2.3M revenue impact.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Data Generation → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Model Registry → Deployment
     ↓                    ↓                ↓              ↓         ↓
• 50K clients      • Engagement        • XGBoost       • Version   • Batch API
• 7.5M events      • Financial         • Random Forest • Control   • Real-time
• Real-time        • Behavioral        • Native ML     • Governance• Monitoring
```

**Technology Stack:**
- **Snowflake**: Data warehouse, ML platform, model registry
- **Snowpark ML**: Native ML training and inference  
- **SQL UDFs**: Batch inference (primary deployment)
- **Container Services**: Real-time inference (optional)
- **Streamlit**: Management dashboard

## 🚀 Quick Start (10 minutes)

### 1. **Setup Snowflake** (2 min)
```sql
-- Run this SQL in your Snowflake worksheet
-- Copy/paste contents of: snowflake_setup.sql
```

### 2. **Run ML Pipeline** (5 min)
```bash
# Execute these 5 notebooks in Snowflake UI:
# 01_Data_Generation_Snowflake.ipynb
# 02_Feature_Engineering_Snowflake.ipynb  
# 03_Model_Training_Registry_Snowflake.ipynb
# 04_Inference_Deployment_Snowflake.ipynb
# 05_ML_Observability.ipynb
```

### 3. **Deploy & Monitor** (3 min)
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Deploy batch inference (primary approach)
python deployment/simplified_deployment.py

# Launch management dashboard
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

**🎉 That's it! Your ML pipeline is live and scoring clients daily.**

## 🎯 Deployment Options

### **Option 1: Batch Inference** (Recommended - 95% of use cases)
- Scores all clients daily at 6 AM
- Zero maintenance after setup
- Handles thousands of clients seamlessly
- Use for: Daily campaigns, portfolio analysis, advisor prioritization

### **Option 2: Real-time Inference** (Optional - 5% of use cases)  
- <100ms response times
- Use ONLY for: Live advisor calls, instant website recommendations
- Higher complexity and resource requirements

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Management

### **View Predictions:**
```sql
-- Today's client scores
SELECT client_id, conversion_probability, recommended_action
FROM model_predictions 
WHERE DATE(prediction_timestamp) = CURRENT_DATE()
ORDER BY conversion_probability DESC;

-- High-value prospects for advisors
SELECT * FROM model_predictions 
WHERE conversion_probability > 0.7;
```

### **Model Health:**
```sql
-- Performance metrics
SELECT * FROM model_health_dashboard;

-- Active alerts  
SELECT * FROM ml_observability_alerts 
WHERE status = 'open';
```

### **Dashboard Access:**
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
# Navigate to: http://localhost:8501
```

---

## ⚡ Troubleshooting

### **No predictions generated:**
```sql
-- Check batch scoring task
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tasks 
WHERE name = 'DAILY_BATCH_SCORING';

-- Run manually if needed
CALL run_daily_batch_scoring();
```

### **Dashboard won't connect:**
- Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml` with your Snowflake credentials
- See streamlit_app.py comments for format

### **Event streaming issues:**
```bash
# Test the demo streaming
python demo_streaming.py
# Choose option 1 for quick 2-minute test
```
