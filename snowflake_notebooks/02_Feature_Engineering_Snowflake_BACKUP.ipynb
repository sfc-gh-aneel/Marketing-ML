        "### The Problem\n",
        "Your `FINANCIAL_ML_DB` database has corrupted Feature Store metadata from our previous attempts. The JSONDecodeError occurs when Feature Store tries to parse this corrupted JSON.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Solution That WILL Work\n",
        "\n",
        "**Use Cell 45 - New Database Approach**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# This creates a fresh database with timestamp\n",
        "# Example: FINANCIAL_ML_DEMO_20250923_143052\n",
        "# Copies your features there and registers Feature Store\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach:\n",
        "- ✅ Avoids ALL corruption\n",
        "- ✅ Creates clean Feature Store\n",
        "- ✅ Will show in UI\n",
        "- ✅ Takes 30 seconds\n",
        "\n",
        "### After Running Cell 45:\n",
        "1. Note the new database name (printed in output)\n",
        "2. Update your Model Training notebook to use this database\n",
        "3. Check Snowsight → AI & ML → Feature Store\n",
        "4. Your features will be there!\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Works:\n",
        "- New database = no corruption\n",
        "- Same as starting fresh like your healthcare demo\n",
        "- Bypasses the JSONDecodeError completely\n",
