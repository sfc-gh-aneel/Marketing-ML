## 🔧 Technical Architecture Details

### Data Pipeline
```python
# Synthetic data generation
clients_df = generator.generate_client_profiles(50000)
events_df = generator.generate_marketing_events(clients_df, 150)

# Feature engineering
engagement_features = engineer.create_engagement_features()
financial_features = engineer.create_financial_features()
behavioral_features = engineer.create_behavioral_features()
```

### Model Training
```python
# Multiple model approaches
pytorch_models = pytorch_trainer.train_all_models(df)
xgboost_models = traditional_trainer.train_xgboost_models(X, targets)
sklearn_models = traditional_trainer.train_random_forest_models(X, targets)
```

### Deployment
```python
# Snowflake Model Registry
registry.register_sklearn_model(model_path, model_name, model_type)

# Inference pipeline
predictions = pipeline.generate_comprehensive_predictions(features_df)
api_response = pipeline.real_time_inference(client_features)
