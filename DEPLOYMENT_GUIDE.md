# Simplified ML Deployment Guide
## Financial Services ML Pipeline

This guide provides a **practical, simplified approach** to ML deployment that covers 99% of financial services use cases.

## üéØ Deployment Strategy

### **Primary Approach: Batch Inference** (Recommended for 95% of use cases)
- **Efficiency**: Very high (native Snowflake)
- **Maintenance**: Zero
- **Performance**: Processes all clients in minutes
- **Use for**: Daily/weekly client scoring, portfolio analysis, campaign targeting

### **Secondary Approach: Real-time Inference** (Only when needed)
- **Efficiency**: Moderate (container services)
- **Maintenance**: Moderate
- **Performance**: <100ms response time
- **Use for**: Live advisor calls, instant website recommendations

---

## üöÄ Quick Start - Batch Deployment (Primary)

### 1. Run the Deployment Script
```bash
cd /Users/aneel/Desktop/Marketing-ML
python deployment/simplified_deployment.py
```

### 2. What It Creates:
- ‚úÖ **Batch prediction UDF**: Native Snowflake function
- ‚úÖ **Daily scoring procedure**: Automated batch processing
- ‚úÖ **Scheduled task**: Runs every morning at 6 AM
- ‚úÖ **Monitoring dashboard**: Track predictions and performance

### 3. That's It!
Your model is deployed and will automatically score all clients daily.

---

## ‚ö° Optional: Real-time Deployment (Advanced)

**Only proceed if you need <100ms response times**

### When You Actually Need Real-time:
- ‚úÖ Advisor is on a live call with a client
- ‚úÖ Client is actively browsing your website
- ‚úÖ Real-time recommendation engine
- ‚ùå Daily email campaigns (use batch)
- ‚ùå Monthly portfolio reviews (use batch)
- ‚ùå Quarterly reports (use batch)

### Setup Real-time:
```bash
python deployment/realtime_container_service.py
```

---

## üìä How to Use Your Deployed Models

### Batch Predictions (Daily Automatic)
```sql
-- View today's predictions
SELECT client_id, conversion_probability, recommended_action
FROM model_predictions 
WHERE DATE(prediction_timestamp) = CURRENT_DATE()
ORDER BY conversion_probability DESC;

-- High-value prospects
SELECT client_id, conversion_probability, recommended_action
FROM model_predictions 
WHERE conversion_probability > 0.7
ORDER BY conversion_probability DESC;
```

### Real-time Predictions (On-demand)
```sql
-- Real-time prediction for a specific client
SELECT predict_conversion_predictor_monitored(
    'client_12345',  -- client_id
    0.75,           -- engagement_score_30d
    95000,          -- annual_income
    125000,         -- current_401k_balance
    42,             -- age
    2               -- service_tier_numeric (1=Basic, 2=Premium, 3=Elite)
);
```

## üéõÔ∏è Management Dashboard

### Launch Streamlit App
```bash
cd /Users/aneel/Desktop/Marketing-ML
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Features:
- üìä **Pipeline Overview**: Health metrics and status
- üöÄ **Model Deployment**: One-click deployment interface
- üîç **Model Monitoring**: Performance tracking and alerts
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Feature Management**: Feature store status
- üìà **Business Insights**: ROI and conversion analysis

---

## üîç Monitoring Your Deployment

### Batch Inference Health Check
```sql
-- Check if batch scoring is working
SELECT 
    DATE(prediction_timestamp) as prediction_date,
    COUNT(*) as clients_scored,
    ROUND(AVG(conversion_probability), 3) as avg_conversion_prob
FROM model_predictions
WHERE prediction_timestamp >= DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
GROUP BY DATE(prediction_timestamp)
ORDER BY prediction_date DESC;
```

### Real-time Performance (if deployed)
```sql
-- Real-time performance metrics
SELECT * FROM realtime_performance_dashboard
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Model Performance Monitoring
```sql
-- Model accuracy over time
SELECT * FROM model_health_dashboard;

-- Recent alerts
SELECT * FROM ml_observability_alerts 
WHERE status = 'open' 
ORDER BY alert_timestamp DESC;
```

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### Batch Inference Benefits:
- **Compute**: Efficient use of Snowflake warehouse resources
- **Storage**: Minimal prediction table storage needed
- **Scalability**: Handles thousands of clients seamlessly

### Real-time Inference Considerations:
- **Container Services**: Higher resource requirements
- **Compute Pool**: Dedicated compute resources needed
- **Complexity**: Additional infrastructure management

### Recommendation:
**Start with batch inference only**. Add real-time only when business requires <100ms responses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Batch Inference Issues

**Problem**: No predictions generated today
```sql
-- Check task status
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tasks 
WHERE name = 'DAILY_BATCH_SCORING';

-- Manually run batch scoring
CALL run_daily_batch_scoring();
```

**Problem**: Poor prediction quality
```sql
-- Check feature quality
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_clients,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN engagement_score_30d IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_engagement,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN annual_income IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_income
FROM feature_store;
```

### Real-time Inference Issues

**Problem**: High response times
```sql
-- Check performance
SELECT 
    AVG(response_time_ms) as avg_response_time,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN source = 'fallback' THEN 1 END) as fallback_count
FROM realtime_inference_log
WHERE timestamp >= DATEADD(hour, -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());
```

**Problem**: Service not responding
- Container service may be down
- Fallback predictions will still work
- Check compute pool status in Snowsight

## üí° Best Practices

### Do:
- ‚úÖ Start with batch inference
- ‚úÖ Monitor model performance regularly
- ‚úÖ Use business rules alongside ML predictions
- ‚úÖ Keep fallbacks for all real-time systems

### Don't:
- ‚ùå Deploy real-time without clear business need
- ‚ùå Ignore model monitoring
- ‚ùå Over-engineer the solution
- ‚ùå Skip the dashboard - business users need visibility
